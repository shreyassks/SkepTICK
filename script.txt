Good afternoon,
My name is shreeyash. AI Research Engineer at Philips.
Our team works at JusPay, CRISIL, KHOROS.

The problem statement we worked on was Identifying misleading claims. 

== Relatability in problem statement
You are scrolling your youtube feed, and come acoross a video promising
low risk, high growth, small caps stock.

Ofcourse you click on it, but this time you have our plugin SkepTICK to help you.

Why Youtube Plugin? Cheapest, Fastest and easiest way to reach scale on day 1 itself

What SkepTICK does:
=== Credibility module

Imagine how facebook suggests you friends, or how linkedin shows you possible connections? There is some underlying graph structure that they use.
We used similar technology - called as knowledge graph, and simply changed yourself to youtber, your friends to Stocks, and relation between them as credibility.

We extracted and trained such model to give us credibility score of youtuber per stock.

In this example, 75% is credibility of Rahul for stock GTBL

== backtest module

Now, they people also give lot of technical "gyan".
